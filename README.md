## Legacy website
The existing website built in 2007 on Wordpress hasn't been updated since (save for setting up a mobile experience via. WPtouch).

## Project Description
The revamping of the site is long overdue. It's a perfect opportunity to learn technologies for static site building.
This repo will inhertic the static content from the old site. Pages will be converted to Markdown files, the images will be re-sourced (from Wikimedia Commons or other) and optimized.

### Technical specs
The new site will be based on Jekyll.

*TBD:*
- Theming: Jekyll Themes, CSS, SASS, Bootsrap, Bulma???
- Hosting: Websupport, Firebase???
- ???
